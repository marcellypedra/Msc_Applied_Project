# Msc_Applied_Project

This repository was created to develop an Applied Research Project submitted in partial fulfillment of the
requirement for the degree of M. Sc. In Information Systems with Computing At Dublin Business School.

It contains jupyter notebooks to process and analyze NHIS adult23 dataset and use it to train Graph-based ML models on detecting bias in Mental health predictions, based on Social Detarminants (WHO), more specfically the ones related to Discrimiantion and Inequality ( ex.: racism, sexism, ableism, etc). Furthermore, it will provide insights on how it is possible to improve fairness and minimize bias on Machine Learning

It intends to get documented the whole process going through the Data Preparation to Evaluation phases as described in CRISP-DM methodology.
